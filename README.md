Prostate Cancer Classification (Course Project)

Employed non-parametric supervised technique "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)" with k = 5 on a Prostate Cancer dataset.
Utilized KNN to classify new instances into the categories of Benign (B) and Malignant (M).
Explored feature selection and data preprocessing techniques to enhance classification accuracy.
Applied rigorous evaluation methods to assess the performance and robustness of the KNN model.
Presented project findings, including the classification results and insights gained from the analysis.
This project demonstrated your proficiency in utilizing the KNN algorithm for classification tasks, specifically in the context of prostate cancer. It showcased your ability to handle real-world datasets, implement appropriate data preprocessing techniques, and employ effective evaluation methodologies.
